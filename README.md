**Hey there! ðŸ‘‹**

Welcome to **Schooled Code**! This repo is all about my journey learning programming for college. Itâ€™s packed with the programs I practiced for my labs to really grasp the concepts in detail.

Also, check out the [latex-record-template](link-to-your-folder) if you need it!

Feel free to dive in and use anything you find here!

Happy coding, and enjoy the ride! ðŸš€
